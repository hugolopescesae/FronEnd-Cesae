User Interface (UI):

In essence, User Interface (UI) represents the visual and interactive components of a product, acting as the gateway for user interaction. It encompasses a fusion of visual elements, such as icons, buttons, and menus, crafted to provide users with an intuitive and accessible means to navigate and engage with software applications or digital platforms.

User Experience (UX):

On the other hand, User Experience (UX) encompasses the broader perspective, going beyond the tangible UI elements. UX is the all-encompassing impression that users derive from their entire interaction journey with a product or service. It delves into the emotional aspect, addressing how users feel and perceive the product, as well as their satisfaction with the overall experience.


Slide 11
From now on we will aproach the user centered quiz acessibility, using real examples...

Slide 12/13/14/15
Starting from the background color/image, as you can see that using a simple gradient color will make it easier to create a contrast between the letters and background, in that way, turning accesible for everyone! Furthermore, increasing the font size will reinforce the point said earlier! 

On the other hand we aligned the text to the center of the page, and clarified the options to improve the UX(User experience).

In addition to keep improving the UI/UX, using options instead of text-writing camps, will enhance the quiz quality making it better for the user. 

Likewise on the slides before, when talking about the higher contrast between the letters and background, we did the same for the numbers and stars.
